# Build Process

## Day 1 – Problem Framing

On Day 1, I focused on understanding the assignment and clearly defining the scope of the system.

- Defined the core problem statement: helping engineering students make structured career decisions.
- Selected five career options to keep the scope realistic and manageable.
- Identified six evaluation criteria to balance comprehensiveness and usability.
- Designed an initial weighted scoring approach to ensure transparency and personalization.

At this stage, the focus was conceptual clarity rather than implementation.

## Day 2 – System Structuring

On Day 2, I refined the initial idea into a structured system design.

- Formalized the scoring methodology using deterministic weighted aggregation.
- Introduced normalization to ensure fairness across criteria.
- Structured the system into modular components (Input Handler, Validator, Scoring Engine, etc.).
- Considered edge cases such as weight validation and division-by-zero scenarios.

The focus shifted from "what the system does" to "how the system is architected internally."
