# Research Log

This document records external references and AI assistance used during development.

## Day 1

Researched:
- Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)
- Weighted scoring models
- Deterministic vs black-box systems

AI was used to:
- Refine the problem statement
- Structure the README
- Clarify technical terms (CLI, normalization, deterministic logic)

Decision:
Chose weighted scoring instead of machine learning to maintain transparency and explainability.

## Day 2

Researched:
- Score normalization methods
- Basic sensitivity analysis concepts
- Modular system design

AI was used to:
- Validate scoring formula
- Improve documentation clarity
- Review architectural structure

AI was not used to:
- Generate rankings
- Replace the core decision logic

The final decision engine remains fully deterministic.
